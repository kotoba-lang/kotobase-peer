(ns kotobase-peer.cache
  "The host side of the block cache — the effects `merkle-lsm` has always
  declared and nothing has ever interpreted.

  `kotobase-peer.merkle-lsm` emits `{:effect/type :cache/get :cid ...}` and
  `{:effect/type :cache/put ...}`. Grep the repo before this namespace existed
  and those two effect types appear exactly twice: at their own definitions.
  The design left a hole for a block cache and nobody filled it, so every read
  went to the object store and every block was re-hashed on arrival.

  What makes this safe is the same thing that makes it small: **a CID-keyed
  cache needs no invalidation.** A content-addressed block cannot change under
  its key, so there is no TTL, no coherence protocol, and no write path to
  keep in step. See `kotoba-lang/block-cache`.

  Two seams, because kotobase-peer has two:

  - `cached-get-fn` wraps the synchronous `(fn [cid] bytes)` that `datoms`,
    `cold-datoms` and `hydrate-db` take. Nothing in this repo changes; the
    HOST composes it.
  - `handle-effect` interprets the merkle-lsm cache effects for a host that
    executes an effect list."

  never read again. The 8 KB threshold sits under the smallest data-block
  class, so nodes land in the protected segment and blocks do not.

  Defaults total 20 MB against a 128 MB isolate — deliberately conservative,
  since the working set has to share that budget with the rows the query is
