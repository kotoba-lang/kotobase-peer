  "Lightweight, salted-hash proof-of-retrievability for pinned blocks — a
   periodic challenge/response BETWEEN REPLICA-HOLDING PEERS, not a
   trustless prover-only scheme (see HONEST SCOPE below). Redesigned in
   cljc from the pre-Rust-deletion kotoba-dht/availability_proof.rs
   sketch (legacy ADR-2605252200 §5.2, 'lightweight PoSt'); reuses this
   codebase's own portable SHA-256 (multiformats.core/sha256, real
   JVM+cljs parity) instead of introducing blake3. See
   90-docs/adr/2607051410-net-kotobase-distributed-storage-mesh-design.md
   (com-junkawasaki/root) for the design this implements.

   HONEST SCOPE: this is NOT Filecoin's PoRep/PoSt. A verifier holding
   only a CID (a hash) cannot check hash(bytes ++ nonce) without already
   possessing bytes — hash functions don't let you derive H(x||y) from
   H(x) alone. So `verify` below requires the VERIFIER to independently
   resolve the same block through its own get-fn (another replica-
   holding peer, the tenant's own kept copy, or a rotating auditor from
   an L3 provider-list) — this proves ongoing possession/freshness
   between two parties who both once had the data, at the cost of one
   compact hash instead of re-transferring the whole block every epoch.
   Justified because kekkai gates mesh membership to known identities
   (not an anonymous adversarial market) and durable pins already
   require replication >= 2 for plain durability — so a verifying
   replica-holder already exists at the tiers this audit is offered on
   (see redundancy-tiers)."
