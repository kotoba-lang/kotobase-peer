;; kotobase-engine until ADR-2607050700 -- "kotobase" itself was already
;; taken by the client-side IStore port, kotoba-lang/kotobase), assembled
;; from the already-landed Wave 1-3 primitives (ADR-2607010930 Phase 6 +
;; ADR-2607022600): arrangement (hot 4-covering-index Arrangement + query
;; routing + per-commit snapshot -- formerly two repos, quad-store and kqe,
;; merged into one per ADR-2607050700), chain (append-only chain/verify,
;; renamed from commit-dag per ADR-2607050800). This is the piece
;; that implements the `ai.gftd.apps.kotobase.datomic.*` surface
;; (transact/datoms/q/pull) end to end, backed by content-addressed,
;; verifiable persistence, in CLJC.
;;
;; ADR-2607032430 (log-structured write path): the original `commit!` snapshotted
;; a full hot db into 4 fresh prolly-trees on EVERY write -- O(graph). Confirmed
;; live 2026-07-03 as the root cause of a CF Worker CPU-limit collapse (error 1102)
;; during a 321-actor mass write. `commit!` is now a novelty-log APPEND (O(tx)):
;; chain's opaque `state` carries `{"indexed" <snapshot Link>|nil "novelty-front"
;; <Link>|nil "novelty-back" <Link>|nil "novelty-count" <int>}` -- a two-list
;; persistent-queue novelty log (kotoba-lang/kotobase-peer#16; front/back are
;; cons-chains of small nodes, not a flat vector -- see the "persistence"
;; section below for the full design and why the ORIGINAL D1 landing's flat-
;; vector `"novelty"` [<tx-block Link> ...] was still O(n) per write despite
;; this comment's O(tx) claim). A write puts one small tx block and pushes ONE
;; new small cons node onto `novelty-back`, touching neither a prolly-tree,
;; the graph itself, nor any EXISTING novelty entry. `fold!` compacts novelty
;; into a fresh `indexed` snapshot (the same O(graph) work the old `commit!` always
;; did, now amortized over however many writes accumulated first) and is content-
;; addressed -- deterministic, safe for any writer (server cron, a browser at idle)
;; to run redundantly. Reads go through `hot-datoms` (indexed snapshot, range-pruned,
;; + novelty merged in memory) instead of `hydrate-db` + `datoms` wherever a full hot
;; db value isn't actually needed.
;;
;; Composition decision (resolves the ADR-2607022600 "quad-store/commit! and
;; commit-dag are two unmerged implementations" gap -- quoting that ADR's own
;; wording verbatim; "quad-store" in the quote is arrangement post-ADR-2607050700
;; rename, "commit-dag" in the quote is chain post-ADR-2607050800 rename):
;; arrangement/commit! is called
;; with `prev` always nil here — it is used ONLY to snapshot the 4 indexes into
;; content-addressed prolly-trees and return one CID for that snapshot. Chain
;; history, `:seq`, and tamper/gap verification are chain's job, wrapping
;; the {indexed, novelty} state map as its opaque `state`. Neither library is

   NOT `arrangement.query`'s `{:s :p :o}` quad shape (`:e`/`:a` name the same
   positions as `:s`/`:p`, but `:v_edn` is already the wire-encoded EDN string,
   not the raw decoded value, and `:added` is present too) -- a caller
   filtering by entity/attribute (the common case: can this actor see this
   entity, is this attribute public) needs no decoding to do so; a caller
   that must decide on the raw value can `clojure.edn/read-string` `:v_edn`
   itself. Pass `(constantly true)` to see everything, as an explicit choice.

   2-arg (`[db visible?]`) → whole-db (:eavt full scan, unchanged). 3-arg
   additionally honors an optional `{:index :components :limit}` SERVER-SIDE
   via arrangement's index accessors, so a filtered read (e.g. getBackup by
   entity, or by [attr value]) materialises ONLY the matching entity/attr
   instead of the whole graph — the root fix for the deployed wasm worker
   ignoring index/components_edn/limit and rehydrating the full graph per read
   (ADR-2607022330 addendum 2).

   `:index` ∈ #{:eavt :aevt :avet :vaet} (default :eavt); `:components` is an

   [a …], :vaet=[v a …] -- reverse-reference only, populated for ref-valued
   quads, see the :vaet case below); values are the opaque strings
   arrangement stores (the PDS's :db/id for e, `:ns/attr` for a, the stored
   value string for v). `kotoba-lang/kotobase-client`'s own `datoms` has
   always documented `:vaet` as a valid index (see its docstring) -- this
   fn previously had no matching `case` clause AND no default, so any
   caller actually sending `:vaet` (a documented, not hypothetical, request
   shape) crashed with an unhandled-case exception instead of a graceful
   error. Confirmed 2026-07-08, fixed here. `visible?` is applied BEFORE `:limit`
   is taken, so `:limit` caps the row count the caller actually receives (all
   of them visible), not the count of raw candidates scanned."

;; guarantee regardless of history).
;;
;; Pre-D1 chains store a BARE snapshot Link as `state` (the original commit!,

     within that call (not just in the cold scan) restarts the ENTIRE
     `h/handle` invocation from scratch, including redoing the (now

     can mean dozens to hundreds of full restarts -- exactly the kind of
     redundant-retry cost `scan-prefix-async` fixed for the cold side, just
     relocated to the novelty side. Routing novelty reads through a direct

  ADR-2607051000 (accepted 2026-07-06): each component is run through
  `link->edn` THEN `blind-fn` (REQUIRED, the SAME keyed MAC
  `arrangement.core/index-root` used to build the key -- `index-root`'s own
  key construction is `(blind-fn (link->edn component))` for every
  position, see its docstring), so a caller who already knows the
  plaintext component independently re-derives the identical blinded
  prefix bytes to seek on.

  The `link->edn` step was MISSING here until 2026-07-08 (\"an orthogonal,
  pre-existing gap this ADR doesn't touch\", per this docstring's own prior
  wording) -- harmless for every index THIS fn was actually exercised
  against before then (`:eavt`/`:aevt`/`:avet` components are always
  plain strings in practice: entity ids, attribute names, scalar values --
  `link->edn` on a non-Link value is already a no-op passthrough, so
  omitting the call never changed the result). `:vaet` (added 2026-07-08)
  is the first index whose OWN seek components are genuinely Link-typed
  by design (VAET's whole point is reverse-reference lookup on ref
  values) -- for those, skipping `link->edn` produced a seek prefix
  blinded from the wrong input, silently matching nothing. Confirmed live
  via `cold-datoms`'s own `:vaet` test, fixed here rather than deferred
  again now that a real caller (`:vaet`) actually needs it.

   keyed by `snapshot-cid` (`hydrate-cache-key`) -- so a fold retried against
   the SAME still-unfolded snapshot (the common case while a backlog is too
   large to clear in one attempt: `snapshot-cid` doesn't change between
   retries since no fold has succeeded yet) skips straight to a cache hit
   instead of re-paying the O(graph_shard) decrypt-and-scan on every single
   retry (ADR-2607120730 Part 1, \"memoized hydration\").

   `cache-put!` is invoked as soon as the rows are computed -- BEFORE the
   caller applies novelty/re-commits -- specifically so a fold attempt that
   hydrates successfully but then exceeds its CPU budget LATER (applying
   novelty, or `qs/commit!`'s tree rebuild) still leaves the cache populated
   for the next attempt. This is why `cache-put!` must be a storage write
   that lands immediately, NOT one threaded through a buffered end-of-request
   flush (e.g. `kotobase-cljc-worker`'s `run-write-attempt` buffers `put!`
   and only flushes to R2 after the whole call returns a response) -- a
   cache write buffered that way would be lost on exactly the failure this
   fn exists to survive.

   `cache-get`/`cache-put!` are `(fn [key]) -> bytes|nil` / `(fn [key bytes])`
   on JVM (synchronous, matching `get-fn`/`put!`'s own JVM contract); on cljs
   they are Promise-returning (`(fn [key]) -> js/Promise<bytes|nil>` /
   `(fn [key bytes]) -> js/Promise<_>`) since a real cache-put! is a direct
   (unbuffered) R2 write, unlike the synchronous `get-fn`/`put!` block-store
   trampoline.

   Serialization deliberately does NOT `pr-str` a `cold-datoms` row
   (`{:e :a :v_edn :added}`) as-is: `:v_edn` is already a safely-encoded EDN
   string (`v->edn`'s `qs/link->edn` form, readable with no custom reader),
   but `:e`/`:a` are raw decoded values that -- exactly like `:v` before
   `v->edn` -- may themselves be `ipld.core` Links, which plain `pr-str`
   shreds into a bare, untyped seq on read-back (the same regression
   `v->edn`'s docstring/ADR-2607051000 follow-up already document for `:v`).
   Each row is therefore re-encoded through the SAME `v->edn`/`qs/edn->link`
   round-trip for `:e` and `:a` too before caching.

   `async-get-fn` (optional, `:cljs` only, nil-safe -- absent falls back to
   `cold-datoms`'s `with-blocks`-trampolined scan, identical to before this
   param existed): a DIRECT Promise-returning `(fn [cid]) -> js/Promise
   <bytes>`, routed to `cold-datoms-async` instead of `cold-datoms` --
   confirmed live (ADR-2607120730 follow-up) to fix the actual dominant
   cost of a stuck fold: `with-blocks`' one-miss-per-retry-from-root
   trampoline re-walks/re-decodes every already-fetched node on every
   retry, O(N^2) for a tree touching N distinct blocks, regardless of
   `cache-get`/`cache-put!` (which only helps a SECOND attempt against an
   already-hydrated snapshot -- if the FIRST hydrate itself never
   completes, cache-put! never even fires). `cold-datoms-async`'s batched-
   concurrent discovery is O(N)."

   an identical fact is a no-op.

   HONEST LIMITATION: content seeded via `snapshot!` (the cold-start/
   migration entry point, NOT the novelty-log `commit!` path) has no
   individual assert history -- it was never transacted through the

;; ── materialized views (RisingWave-style IVM on IPLD, ADR-2607166600) ───────
;; A view is a named, declaratively-specified projection of the graph's
;; CURRENT STATE — today's spec language is {"attrs" [attr ...]}: the rows
;; whose :a is in that set — materialized at fold time as ONE
;; content-addressed dag-cbor block and linked from the chain state under
;; "views". The RisingWave mapping: novelty tx-blocks are the stream, fold!
;; is the barrier/checkpoint, the views block is the MV state in shared
;; storage, and `view-rows` merges unfolded novelty on read (same hot/cold
;; split as hot-datoms) so reads are always fresh without waiting for the
;; next fold. Because the MV is content-addressed and reachable from the
;; chain head, ANY peer that syncs the chain serves the identical view with
;; one block read — no central cache. `commit!` (transact) carries "views"
;; forward untouched (its new-state merges over the old state map); only
;; fold! re-materializes. Rows are stored AEAD-encrypted as one opaque
;; ciphertext, exactly like tx-blocks (whole-block reads, no keyed seek, so
;; no blind-index concern — ADR-2607051000's put-tx-block! precedent).
;;
;; Phase 1 derives each view's rows from the fold's already-hydrated merged
;; db (zero extra reads — fold! pays the full hydrate regardless). When fold
;; itself goes incremental, view maintenance becomes O(novelty) delta
;; application against the previous view block (RisingWave's actual IVM);
;; the stored shape already supports that (spec travels with rows).

(defn fold!
  "Compact `chain-cid`'s novelty into a fresh indexed snapshot: hydrate the
  current `indexed` snapshot, re-assert every novelty quad on top (append
  order), `qs/commit!` that as the new `indexed`, and append ONE new
  chain entry. Cost: O(graph_shard) — the same full rebuild `snapshot!`/the
  pre-D1 `commit!` always paid, now amortized over however many `commit!`
  writes accumulated the folded novelty instead of being paid on every
  single one (`should-fold?`/`novelty-size` decide when to call this;
  correctness never depends on it running promptly).

  `max-novelty` (optional, default nil = unbounded/full fold, exactly
  today's behavior): caps how many of the OLDEST not-yet-folded tx blocks
  this call folds, leaving the rest as the new state's `novelty` tail
  instead of always emptying it. Novelty is stored oldest-first (`commit!`
  `conj`s each new tx-block link onto the END), so `take max-novelty`/
  `drop max-novelty` folds strictly in chronological (append) order and the
  remaining tail is exactly what a later `fold!` call would still need to
  process — correctness (retraction-vs-earlier-assertion resolution, which
  `apply-quad`'s reduce already handles by walking `indexed` then novelty
  in order) is identical whether one call folds everything or N calls each
  fold a bounded slice, since each call's own `hydrate-db` picks up
  whatever the PREVIOUS call already committed to `indexed`.

  Motivation (found live, gftdcojp/app-aozora#78): bounding `pmap-async`'s
  in-flight fetch count (see that fn's docstring) fixes the Workers
  subrequest-concurrency collapse for a MODERATE novelty backlog, but a
  backlog large enough that even batched-but-still-sequential processing
  of the WHOLE thing exceeds one Worker invocation's CPU/wall-time budget
  can leave `fold!` itself unable to ever complete — a runaway: novelty
  can only shrink via a successful fold, but the fold needed to shrink it
  never finishes. `max-novelty` breaks that: a fold cron can call `fold!`
  with a small bounded budget every cycle and make guaranteed forward
  progress (novelty strictly shrinks by up to `max-novelty` per successful
  call) even against a backlog too large to clear in one invocation,
  instead of repeatedly attempting (and losing all the work of) one
  all-or-nothing fold that never finishes.

  Since kotoba-lang/kotobase-peer#16's fix: reading which entries to fold
  (unbounded: everything; bounded: the oldest `max-novelty`) no longer
  requires decoding the WHOLE novelty backlog just to find them — see
  `novelty-cids`/`take-oldest-novelty`'s own docstrings for the front/back
  persistent-queue design and its (amortized, not flat-per-call) cost
  story.

  Deterministic FOR A GIVEN novelty-cids ordering and a given `max-novelty`
  choice: prolly-tree/arrangement are content-addressed, so folding the
  identical (indexed, to-fold-slice) pair — from ANY writer, a server cron
  or a browser at idle — always produces the same snapshot CID. Concurrent
  folds of the same state with the same `max-novelty` are safe, redundant,
  and cheap (re-`put!`ing already-stored bytes is a no-op at the
  block-store layer); this property does NOT require every caller to agree
  on `max-novelty` for overall correctness (only for the 'redundant folds
  converge to the identical intermediate CID' optimization — the sequence
  of indexed snapshots still monotonically absorbs novelty in order either
  way). NOTE (ADR-2607051000, accepted 2026-07-06): this determinism now
  additionally depends on `encrypt-fn` deriving its nonce deterministically
  from the plaintext rather than randomly -- a random-nonce `encrypt-fn`
  would make even identical (indexed, novelty) pairs fold to DIFFERENT
  snapshot CIDs, silently losing the \"cheap redundant fold\" property this
  paragraph otherwise promises. Callers should supply a deterministic
  `encrypt-fn` (e.g. nonce = HMAC(nonce-key, plaintext)) if this property
  matters to them.

  `blind-fn`/`encrypt-fn`/`decrypt-fn` are REQUIRED and threaded to
  `hydrate-db` (blind-fn, decrypt-fn), `read-tx-block` (decrypt-fn), and
  `arrangement.core/commit!` (blind-fn, encrypt-fn). Synchronous on JVM; a
  `js/Promise` of the new chain CID on cljs (the novelty-quads read and the
  snapshot hydrate resolve concurrently there, via `js/Promise.all`, since
  they're independent).

  `async-get-fn` (optional, `:cljs` only, nil-safe) now covers BOTH the
  cold-snapshot hydrate (`cold-datoms-async`, ADR-2607120730's first
  follow-up) AND the novelty tx-block reads (`read-tx-block-async`, this
  addendum) -- confirmed live that routing ONLY the hydrate through it was
  insufficient: a Worker's whole `h/handle` call is one `with-blocks`
  retry loop, and a novelty-block miss restarts the ENTIRE call (redoing
  the hydrate walk too, however fast it now is on its own). Routing BOTH
  read paths through a direct async fetch removes `with-blocks` from
  `fold!`'s critical path entirely, not just from one half of it."
