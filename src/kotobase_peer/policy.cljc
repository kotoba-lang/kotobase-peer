(ns kotobase-peer.policy
  "Read-visibility policy — the concrete form of ADR-2607050500's
  'capability/purpose-scoped redaction' placeholder (Phase 3,
  ADR-2607174500).

  The policy is IN-GRAPH DATA, not worker configuration: datoms on the
  well-known entity `kotobase.policy/read` travel with the chain, so any
  peer that syncs the graph enforces the identical policy — the same
  distribution argument as the materialized views (ADR-2607166600).

  Model (deliberately minimal, additive later):
    {:db/id \"kotobase.policy/read\"
     :kotobase.policy/protected-prefixes \"[\\\":dm.\\\" \\\":secret.\\\"]\"}
  Rows whose :a starts with ANY protected prefix are visible only to a
  viewer with sufficient CLEARANCE. A graph with NO policy entity is fully
  public — exactly today's behavior, so rollout is zero-regression by
  construction.

  Clearance has four levels, not two (ADR-2607280100 D3). A policy may add

    :kotobase.policy/prefix-levels \"{\\\":dm.\\\" :confidential}\"

  which says how protected each prefix is; the prefix LIST still says what
  is protected. A prefix with no level is `:restricted`, which is what the
  binary rule already meant — so the old behaviour is the top case of the
  new rule rather than a branch beside it, and every pre-existing policy
  keeps its exact meaning without being rewritten.

  The labels are `kotoba.security.information-flow`'s. There is one
  classification lattice in this workspace (ADR-2607280100 D1, after two
  copies of it were found), and this namespace deliberately does not keep a
  local four-entry map that would be free to drift from it.

  `visible-for` returns the row post-filter every read producer in
  kotobase-peer already threads (datoms / cold-datoms / hot-datoms / q /
  view-rows — 'Query is a first-class effect'): the seam existed
  everywhere, this ns just decides the fn from (policy × viewer caps)."

  clearance, which together reproduce the binary rule exactly.

  Where two prefixes both match an attribute, the HIGHER decides: otherwise
  a broad low-level prefix would be a door into everything beneath it.
